Here are a set of IDs which cause problems for kcite for one reason or
another.

Mikel's paper. Seems to return "null" for title. The equivalent works with a
pubmed ID. 

// pass:[[cite\]10.1186/1471-2105-8-57[/cite]]

// This one errors at pubmed end
// pass:[[cite source="pubmed"\]21362543[/cite\]]
// pass:[[cite source="pubmed"\]21347273[/cite\]]


// This one seems to return null for the title also
// pass:[[cite\]10.1186/gb-2003-4-4-r28[/cite\]]
// Same thing in pubmed. pass:[[cite source="pubmed"\]12702209[/cite\]]


// This one was reported as failing my Carl Boettiger
// pass:[[cite\]10.1126/science.1203698[/cite\]]. 


// This one is my own reality paper [cite]10.1371/journal.pone.0012258[/cite].
// Currently authors are being shown to include Iddo Friedberg. 



Does both of these together break things?
