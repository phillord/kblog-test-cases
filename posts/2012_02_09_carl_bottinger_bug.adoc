Two Problematic DOIs from Carl Boettiger
========================================

Seeing the forest for the trees. Should text-cite as Losos, 2011. 
pass:[[cite\]10.1086/660020[/cite\]].

Early burst of body size... Should cite as text cite Harmon et al, 2010. 
pass:[[cite\]10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01025.x[/cite\]].


The problem seems to be caused by citeproc-js. If this line

[source,javascript]
----
{"family":"Losos","given":"Jonathan B."}
----

is in the citeproc data, then it all fails. If it's not, then it works. Need a
citeproc test bed, I fear, since I am getting no error messages at all. Come
to think of it, I should address the "not checking for errors messages" in
kcite-citeproc.js.
