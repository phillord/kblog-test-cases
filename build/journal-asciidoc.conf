# This file adds support for latexmath. In normal xhtml11 mode, this macro
# uses latexmath to do it's work, which uses javascript to do the translation.
# In this case, we just do some minor re-ordering and let the wordpress
# plugin do the work. 
#
# These macros don't work from here at the moment -- they have to be plugged
# into wordpress.conf, because I can't fiddle with the asciidoc invocation since
# blogpost moved to asciidocapi
