Metadata is a wonderful thing. We can write content here and then post is
straight-forwardly. We can insert a new reference easily
kurl:bio-ontologies.knowledgeblog.org/224[]. We might also want to reference
greycite kurl:www.russet.org.uk/blog/2012/05/greycite-citing-the-web/[],
kblog-metadata kurl:www.russet.org.uk/blog/2012/03/kblog-metadata/[], or kcite
kurl:www.russet.org.uk/blog/2012/02/kcite-spreads-its-wings/[].
