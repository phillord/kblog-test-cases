I am wondering if this pass:[[cite\]http://ontogenesis.knowledgeblog.org/1288[/cite\]]
drops straight through. What about
+++[cite]http://ontogenesis.knowledgeblog.org/1288[/cite]+++ which might work.
Or perhaps even $$[cite]http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19202141[/cite]$$.

Actually, all of these do work, which is pretty good. Does this work with
greycite.el, I wonder this works
efficient$$[cite]http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2012/03/06/an-efficient-journal/[/cite]$$.
