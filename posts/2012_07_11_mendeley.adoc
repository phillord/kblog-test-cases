Mendeley URIs
============
:blogpost-categories: kcite
:blogpost-status: published


This is our first attempt to support Mendeley URIs. This works entirely
through Greycite and accessing the public metadata in the page. 

This is an article that I haven't read about druggable genomes
kurl:www.mendeley.com/research/the-druggable-genome/[]. 

And there is a review article which I have read and am indeed an author on 
kurl:www.mendeley.com/research/semantic-similarity-in-biomedical-ontologies/[].

And my old paper from PSB, which doesn't have a DOI (although does have a
PubMed ID) kurl:www.mendeley.com/research/semantic-similarity-measures-as-tools-for-exploring-the-gene-ontology[].
