Test Post
=========
:blogpost-status: published
:blogpost-categories: ping

This content comes from blogpost and asciidoc. If all is working well, it
should still have the same permalink as the post I created by hand. 

http://yarm.ncl.ac.uk/?page_id=885

First trying to post 

blogpost --post-id=885 --pages --conf-file=../build/local-test-vm.conf
test_repost.adoc


Well, it appears to have worked.
