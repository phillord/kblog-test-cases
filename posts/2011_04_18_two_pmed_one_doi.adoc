Pmed and DOI
============

:blogpost-categories: kcite
:blogpost-status: published

This is a test to detect a specific problem. With the first citeproc version
of kcite, doi's are working fine, but pmed IDs are showing identical
citations. This *should* be a minimal example. 

//pass:[[cite source="pubmed"\]21361458[/cite\]]
//pass:[[cite source="pubmed"\]21361223[/cite\]]
//pass:[[cite\]10.1093/nar/gkl799[/cite\]]


These citations should be the same as kcite_test.html which works. 


pass:[[cite\]10.3998/3336451.0009.101[/cite\]]
pass:[[cite source="pubmed"\]17683567[/cite\]]
pass:[[cite source="pubmed"\]17311682[/cite]]
